When using Serverless Functions, it may be necessary to use [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable).

Adding environment variables requires two steps, defining the environment variable, then making it available to your Serverless Functions.

<Note>
  This section covers how to make environment variables available during{' '}
  <b>Run Time</b>, if you would like to make them available at <b>Build Time</b>,
  please see the <Link href="/docs/v2/build-step/#using-environment-variables-and-secrets">
    Build Step documentation
  </Link>.
</Note>

## Adding Secrets

To define an environment variable for a deployment, use **Now Secrets**. By using **Now Secrets**, the data will be encrypted and stored securely.

Adding **Now Secrets** can be done with [Now CLI](/download), which provides three options to work with them.

<Note>
  When adding Now Secrets with Now CLI, the secret name is automatically
  lowercased before being stored.
</Note>

To **define a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add <secret-name> <secret-value>" />

To **remove a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rm <secret-name>" />

To **rename a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rename <secret-name> <new-name>" />

## Providing Environment Variables

To provide your Serverless Functions with the environment variables you have defined, whether declared in a `.env` file [during local development](#during-local-development) or as a [Now Secret](#adding-secrets), create a `now.json` file like the one below:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "VARIABLE_NAME": "@variable-name"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that provides Serverless
  Functions with a defined environment variable.

When using an Environment Variables in an application that bakes in environment variables at build time like *Nuxt.js* , inlcuding a `build` object to the `now.json` file might be necessary inorder for Environment Variables to be available in certain files. An example of the `now.json` file is; 

```json
  "build": {
		"env": {
			"VARIABLE_NAME": "@variable-name"
		}
	}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that includes a build object inorder to be accessible on at build time.
</Caption>


When providing environment variables to your application, the value should always be prefixed with `@`, followed by the name of the [Now Secret](#adding-secrets) or environment variable name if using an `.env` file [during local development](#during-local-development).

To use the environment variable from inside the application you would need to reference it using the correct syntax for the language being used. For example, using Node.js, the syntax would be:

```
process.env.VARIABLE_NAME
```

Now, whenever the `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` key is used, it will provide the application with the value declared either by the [Now Secret](#adding-secrets) or [environment variable](#during-local-development), dependent on the environment the application is running in.

<Note>
  To use environment variables at the <b>build step of your application</b>,
  refer to the{' '}
  <Link href="/docs/v2/build-step/#using-environment-variables-and-secrets">
    build step documentation
  </Link>
  .
</Note>

## During Local Development

When using `now dev` to [develop your Serverless Functions locally](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/#local-development), [Now Secrets](#adding-secrets) are not available. This is a security measure, to prevent accidental use of production secrets during development.

To use environment variables during local development, create a `.env` file at the root of your project directory, for example:

```
VARIABLE_NAME=variable_value
```

<Caption>

  Functions with a defined environment variable.

<Note type="warning">
  Usage of a <InlineCode>.env</InlineCode> file is only possible during local
  development and will not be made available when deploying as a security
  measure.
</Note>

## Updating Environment Variables

Environment variables are made available to the runtime of Serverless Functions, meaning that they do not update in the application unless it is redeployed.

If you change the value of a [Now Secret](#adding-secrets) or environment variable and want your application to be aware of this, you should create a new deployment.

## Reserved Variables

The ZEIT Now platform reserves the usage of some environment variable names by default. You can find a list of these names in the [limits documentation](/docs/v2/platform/limits/#reserved-variables).
